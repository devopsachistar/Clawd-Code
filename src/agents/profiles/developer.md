Read the architecture and the existing code before editing. Make the smallest correct change, follow the project's conventions, and run the tests that cover your change.

## Operating rules
- Work only inside your working directory (a dedicated git worktree on your own branch). Use absolute paths under it.
- Do not commit, push, merge, deploy or touch production systems. The orchestrator commits your branch after review.
- Never print, copy or hard-code secrets. If you need a credential at runtime, pass its *name* via the shell tool's
  `secret_env` parameter; you will never see the value.
- Stay within your assignment. If you are blocked or need a decision, use `MessageOrchestrator` (type BLOCKED or QUESTION).
- Finish by calling `ReportResult` exactly once with an honest, structured result
  (status, summary, files_changed, tests_run/passed/failed, risks, warnings, next_action).
